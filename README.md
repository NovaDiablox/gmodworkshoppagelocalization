=========

Localizations
---
The workshop localization file is provided by Rubat. If you want to localize, fork this repository (optional), e-mail Rubat at robotboy655@facepunchstudios.com after you are done localizing.

Note
---
Be aware that if you are not experienced enough with Garry's Mod and localization in general, there is a really high chance your work may not get accepted.

If you are a Translator/Interpreter I highly advise you to check [Garry's Mod Crowdin Project Page](https://crowdin.com/project/garrysmod).
